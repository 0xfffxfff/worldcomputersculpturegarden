Subject: Invitation to Contract Show: World Computer Sculpture Garden

Hi ________,

I'd like to extend to you a warm invitation to be part of a new kind of show I'm organizing. "World Computer Sculpture Garden" (working title) will be a contract show scheduled for the end of October this year, and I want you to be part of this.

You can find the curatorial statement and details here: https://contractshow.0xfff.love.

Please let me know if you're interested in participating. I'd be happy to hop on a short call any time to discuss the project in more detail and answer any questions you might have.

Looking forward to your participation!

Best regards,
