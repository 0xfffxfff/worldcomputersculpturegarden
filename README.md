# Contract Show: World Computer Sculpture Garden

A contract show organized by [0xfff](https://x.com/0xShiroi)

with special thanks to sssluke

## Concept

"World Computer Sculpture Garden" is a contract show on Ethereum Mainnet
scheduled for October 2024. Participating artists exhibit their works by
submitting a contract address that is included in the show's main
contract. The only requirement for the pieces is a contract address that
implements a minimal set of fields. The rest is up to the artists.

## Invitation

I invite you into the garden of many running sculptures – an open ground for all to visit. Feel encouraged to move forward, to go beyond the white cube VR-replica spaces, and ignore the stratifying forces that seek to mummify New Art. Dare to disregard their pleas for commodification. Let us re-consider the durable, distributed computational substrate as a canvas for aesthetic, poetic, philosophical, and practical explorations. Open to surprise. Open to delight. Purposefully non-standard. Come and display your creations in the World Computer Sculpture Garden ⚘
