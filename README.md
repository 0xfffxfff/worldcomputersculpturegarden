# Contract Show: World Computer Sculpture Garden

"World Computer Sculpture Garden" is a contract show on Ethereum Mainnet
scheduled for October 2024. Participating artists exhibit their works by
submitting a contract address that is included in the show's main
contract. The only requirement for the pieces is a contract address that
implements a minimal set of fields. The rest is up to the artists.
