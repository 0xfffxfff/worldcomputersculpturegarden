The beginning of a virtual plane and the end, both connected by a straight line. Suddenly structures appear - drawn by entities with addresses. The line finds its way through the emerging labyrinth of walls, it adapts, through their curves and dead ends. At some point the whole structure solidifies, becomes immutable and invisible, unknowable. Only the line remains visible, while the actual origin from which the path was calculated is buried in a cryptographic proof, indecipherable to anyone who didn't take part in its creation. The physical materiality of the mathematical cryptographic proof constitutes an unknowable underlying structure. This plane is connected to another plane that starts from the same point of origin, which is connected to another, and so on - forming a possible infinite line whose underlying exact conditions of production can never be revealed.

These travellers may move forward or backward in time. As they freely start and end their journeys, each block spent travelling adds a character to an endlessly long string, shaping their individual landscape. With each passing day (approximately 7000 blocks), they leave a footprint on a collective landscape, which spreads and becomes part of all other individual landscapes. The contract’s limited read functions only allow viewers to generate fragments.
