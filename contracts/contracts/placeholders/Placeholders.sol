The line finds its way through the emerging labyrinth of walls, it adapts, through their curves and dead ends. At some point the whole structure solidifies, becomes immutable and invisible, unknowable. Only the line remains visible, while the actual origin from which the path was calculated is buried in a cryptographic proof, indecipherable to anyone who didn't take part in its creation. The physical materiality of the mathematical cryptographic proof constitutes an unknowable underlying structure. This plane is connected to another plane that starts from the same point of origin, which is connected to another, and so on - forming a possible infinite line whose underlying exact conditions of production can never be revealed. The appearance of the line is an artefact and remains a surface phenomenon of a cryptographic but provable underlying production.";
