export default "I invite you into the garden of many running sculptures – an open ground for all to visit. This show is an encouragement to move forward, to go beyond the white cube VR-replica spaces, and ignore the stratifying forces that seek to mummify New Art. Dare things. Disregard the pleas for commodification. Re-consider this durable, distributed computational substrate as a canvas for aesthetic, poetic, philosophical, and practical explorations. Open to surprise. Open to delight. Purposefully non-standard. Welcome to the World Computer Sculpture Garden ⚘";
