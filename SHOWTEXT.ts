export default `<p>I invite you into the garden of many running sculptures – an open ground for all to visit. This show is an encouragement to move forward, to go beyond the white cube VR-replica spaces, and ignore the stratifying forces that seek to mummify New Art. Dare things. Disregard the pleas for commodification. Re-consider this durable, distributed, computational substrate as a canvas for aesthetic, poetic, philosophical, and practical explorations. Open to surprise. Open to delight. Purposefully non-standard. Welcome to the World Computer Sculpture Garden ⚘</p>
<p>"World Computer Sculpture Garden" is a contract show on Ethereum Mainnet opening Nov 12, 2024. It is both a show of invidual contracts and a show-as-contract. The term "World Computer Sculpture Garden" – coined by 113 – is a metaphorical reference to Ethereum itself as an unstoppable site and medium for Art. Beyond notions of a global, durable, and programmable conensus layer Ethereum here is understood as a sculpture garden of long-running computer programs <i>as sculptures</i> that may run independently well beyond our lifetime. As such, this show is no closing date.</p>
<p>The website you are viewing was generated at runtime from the show contract itself. Over time, as people engage with the artworks and artists activate their pieces the information rendered here will change. Block for block. Year for year.</p>`;
