export default `<p>I invite you into the garden of many running sculptures – an open ground for all to visit. This is an encouragement to move forward, to go beyond the white cube VR-replica spaces, and ignore the stratifying forces that seek to mummify New Art. Dare things. Disregard the pleas for commodification. Re-consider this durable, distributed, computational substrate as a canvas for aesthetic, poetic, philosophical, and practical explorations. Open to surprise. Open to delight. Purposefully non-standard. Welcome to the World Computer Sculpture Garden.</p>

<p>The contract show "World Computer Sculpture Garden" is opening Nov 12, 2024 on Ethereum Mainnet. It is show <i>as</i> contract as well as a show <i>of</i> contracts. The show's title "World Computer Sculpture Garden" – a term coined by 113 – is a metaphorical reference to Ethereum itself as an unstoppable site for Art. Beyond notions of a global, durable, and programmable conensus layer Ethereum here is understood as a sculpture garden of long-running computer programs <i>as sculptures</i> that may run well beyond our lifetime. As such, this show has no closing date.</p>`;
